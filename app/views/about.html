					<h3>Hey how's it going!</h3>
					 <p>I'm going into my 2nd year in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've recently transferred from Mechatronics Engineering into SE because I have a large interest in algorithms, the various platforms and frameworks for coding, and my desire to build beautiful software.</p>
					 <p><strong>I have a passion for creating cool things and brainstorming solutions to solve difficult problems</strong>. I also enjoy collaborating with people (hackathon, personal projects) and have a desire to learn through discussion with others and through personal research. My current interests are in machine learning, algorithm design, scalable architecture, and optimization.</p>

					<h3>Here are some of the things I love to do</h3>
					<p> • I live a healthy lifestyle which involves eating clean, going for a good workout a few times a week, and being involved in casual sports such as ultimate frisbee, snowboarding, hockey and running.
					</p>
					<p>• I don't think I'm at the level of a "foodie" yet, but I do love eating and trying new foods everywhere.
					</p>
					<p>• Exploring is in my nature. I love experiencing new things whether it be activities, games, or food!
