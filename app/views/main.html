				<h3>Hey what's going on!? Let's get to it</h3>
				 <p>I'm going into my 2nd year in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I actually just transferred from mechatronics engineering because of my interest in algorithms, the various platforms and frameworks for coding, and my desire to build beautiful software.</p>
				 <p><strong>I have a passion for creating cool things and brainstorming solutions to solve difficult problems</strong>. I also enjoy collaborating with people (hackathon, personal projects) and have a desired to learn through discussion with others and through personal research. My current interests are in machine learning, algorithm design, scalable architecture, and code optimization.</p>

				<h3>Here are some of the things I love to do...</h3>
				<p> • I live a healthy lifestyle which involves eating clean and lean, going for a good workout a few times a week, and being involved in casual sports such as ultimate frisbee, snowboarding, hockey and running.
				</p>
				<p>• I don't think I'm at the level of a "foodie" yet, but I do love eating and trying new foods everywhere. Sometimes I call this a "cheat day" because it sometimes goes against my healthy lifestyle :p
				</p>
				<p>• Exploring is in my nature. I love experiencing new things whether it be activities, games, or food!
